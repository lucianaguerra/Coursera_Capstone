Introduction/Business Problem

São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are two of the most important cities in Brazil and, perhaps, in the world.
São Paulo is the main financial and corporate center in South America and also the most populous city in the Southern Hemisphere, with more than 12 million inhabitants. Some cultural sites are widely known, such as "Memorial da América Latina", "Parque Ibirapuera" and "Avenida Paulista".
Rio de Janeiro is the main tourist destination in South America, mainly because of the most famous event: the carnival. It is the second largest city in Brazil and has almost 7 million inhabitants. Here are some famous postcards: "Maracanã", "Arcos da Lapa", "Corcovado", "Pão de Açúcar" and "Praia de Conpacabana".
It is very common for people to have to move from one of these cities to the other. Perhaps because of work, studies or even health care.
Although there are many similar characteristics, the lifestyle in Rio and São Paulo is very different. Thus, when it comes to moving from one to the other, it is good to choose a neighborhood with similar locations, so that adaptation is easier.
In this study, I will organize the neighborhoods of the two cities into clusters according to the headquarters of Foursquare.
